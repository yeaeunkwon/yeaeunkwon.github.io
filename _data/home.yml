  - title: "<b>International Influence in Science</b>"
    url: false
    author: This research investigates international influence in science through research articles. I am focusing on measuring influence between countries across time windows for 1995-2000, using text embeddings and similarity. The unique text embedding method I created represents the research characteristics of each country and enables to measure the influence between core to the peripheral countries in 5 research areas, which are Physical sciences and math, Medical Sciences, Technology and Engineering, Biological and Ecological Sciences, and Social and Behavioral Sciences.
