  - title: "International Influence in Science "
    url: false
    author: This research investigates international influence in science through research articles published from 1995 to 2000. I am focusing on measuring influence between countries across time windows, using text embeddings and similarity. 
    I created the unique text embedding method to represent the research characteristics of each country and measured the influence between core countries to the peripheral countries in 5 research areas, which are Physical sciecnes and math, Medical Sciences,
    Technology and Engineering, Biological and Ecological Sciences, and Social and Behavioral Sciences. Additoinally, we trace the development of research areas within the countries using text analysis.
